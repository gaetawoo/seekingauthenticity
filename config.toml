The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Wouldn't that bring about chaos?"
