I've *got* **a bad** ~~feeling~~ _about_ ***this***.


Somewhere in the middle of the markdown document:

This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing. This is a normal footnote, which directs to the bottom of the document. [^1] This is a dual footnote, which also reuses the url from the footnote for a hyperlink [more on markdown] [A] [^2] This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing. This is me typing.

At the bottom om the document:

[^1]: Here goes the normal footnote, which is used inside the text above.
[^2]: And here the dual footnote, which beside the footnote (link to the bottom) also contains a link out of document including text mouseover (optional).

[A]: https://markdown.dk/ "Here is some optional mouseover text"
