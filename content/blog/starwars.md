I've *got* **a bad** ~~feeling~~ _about_ ***this***.


Somewhere in the middle of the markdown document:

This is a normal footnote, which directs to the bottom of the document. [^1]
This is a dual footnote, which also reuses the url from the footnote for a hyperlink [more on markdown] [A] [^2]

At the bottom om the document:

[^1]: Here goes the normal footnote, which is used inside the text above.
[^2]: And here the dual footnote, which beside the footnote (link to the bottom) also contains a link out of document including text mouseover (optional).

[A]: https://markdown.dk/ "Here is some optional mouseover text"
